# TemperaturIfElse
This code asks the user to input a number then it decides if the user actually wrote a number and not a letter or sign with TryParse
If it passes the TryParse it gets passed allong into a if else statement to check if it's over, under or exactly 0 degrees out.
There is also a 2nd variant in the bottom of the code which has a do while statement instead of while on the v1.
